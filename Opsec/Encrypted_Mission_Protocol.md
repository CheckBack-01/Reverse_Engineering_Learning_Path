# Encrypted Mission Protocol

### **Light Practice Format — Sensitive Intelligence Simulation**

This protocol replaces plain-text delivery of instructions for **PBRs** and **PADs**.  
All instructions are provided **encrypted** and can only be read by following the procedure below.

### **Objective**

Simulate a real-world workflow where critical orders/data are **never exposed directly**, reinforcing skills in:

- Handling sensitive data safely  
- Using **GnuPG** (`gpg`) for encryption and decryption  
- Maintaining a secure, traceable workflow in a lab environment

### **Procedure**

---
### **1) Receive the mission**
You’ll be given an **encrypted data block** in ASCII-armored GPG format.

Example:
```

\-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

hQGMA2kQkYX3h13wAQv+NgkzRvP6o1X8Mox+L6FZxkG41jk4zPUyDl7ff1uZ3TrB
...
\=0a1B
\-----END PGP MESSAGE-----

````
---
### 2) Create the file
On your lab VM (e.g., Kali), save the message to a file:
```bash
nano mission.gpg
````

Paste the encrypted block and save.

---
### **3) Decrypt**

Run:

```bash
gpg --decrypt mission.gpg
```

If prompted, enter the passphrase (provided with the block).

---
### **4) Read & execute**

Once decrypted, you’ll see the full practice instructions.
Execute the mission as directed and document your results.

#### Example Usage

```bash
# Save the mission
nano mission.gpg

# Decrypt
gpg --decrypt mission.gpg
```

**Expected output (sample):**

```
Mission: Scan the internal network and document active hosts.
Tools: nmap, netdiscover.
Objective: Identify possible attack vectors.
```

---
### **Benefits of the Protocol**

* **Security:** Prevents accidental exposure of instructions over insecure channels.
* **Realism:** Mirrors how sensitive data is handled in real operations.
* **Operational discipline:** Enforces secure, auditable handling of confidential information.
